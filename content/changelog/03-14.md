  * Revoking an app's access to your account expires any refresh tokens it has

  * Removed POST /profile/password
  * Removed POST /account/users/:username/password
  * To reset your password, use manager.linode.com

### Fixed

* Fix output for ipv6 RDNS endpoints
  * PUT /networking/ips/:address now returns the modified v6 address
  * PUT /linode/instances/:id/ips/:address now returns the modified v6 address
 * Nothing has changed for these endpoints when :address is a v4 address
* Fixed bug setting RDNS for v6 addresses
* Fixed bug making it impossible to provide authorized_keys when rebuilding a Linode
