### Added:
* Users can now display their Linodes grouped by its tags.
* Users can import existing display groups from Linodes and Domains as tags from the dashboard.
 * For example; If a user were to have three Linodes in the display group "production", a new tag
 of "production" would be created and applied to those three Linodes.
 * The existing display groups remain unchanged.

### Fixed:
* Linode chart statistics sometimes cause a crash.
* Viewing one StackScript, out of 1100, caused the application to crash. Gee thanks!
* URL encoded text was being injected into the search bar.
